# Groundwater ecosystem services - quantifying for the River Fulda floodplain
This repository allows to run process models of a three level (carbon in the form of dissolved organic carbon as a breakdown product from detritus;  microorganisms; fauna) food web breaking down carbon and thus providing the ecosystem service of cleaning up the groundwater. Extension of this model to other questions and use cases is planned - please stay tuned.
